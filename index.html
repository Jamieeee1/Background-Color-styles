                <h2><a name="geophysics">HISTORY OF GEOPHYSICS</a></h2>
                <h3>Ancient and Early Contributions</h3>
                <p> 
                    In ancient times, people observed natural phenomena like earthquakes, volcanoes, and magnetism, which laid the groundwork for early geophysical concepts. The Greeks, notably Aristotle (384–322 BCE), theorized about the Earth’s structure, while the concept of Earth's spherical shape and central position in the universe began to emerge. By the 16th century, the study of magnetism advanced significantly, with William Gilbert (1544–1603), in his work "De Magnete," proposing that the Earth itself is a giant magnet. This was a precursor to understanding geomagnetic fields.
                </p>

                <h3>17th–18th Centuries: Foundations of Modern Geophysics</h3>
                <p> 
                    The development of Newtonian physics in the 17th century was critical for geophysics. Isaac Newton's laws of motion and gravity, formulated in the late 1600s, laid the foundation for the scientific understanding of the Earth’s gravitational field. In the 18th century, the famous Cavendish Experiment by Henry Cavendish measured the Earth’s density, providing insight into the planet’s mass and internal structure. Early efforts to study earthquakes and seismic waves emerged, leading to the eventual development of seismology. 
                </p>

                <h3> 19th Century: Birth of Geophysical Methods </h3>
                <p>
                    The 19th century witnessed major strides in geophysics. The invention of the seismoscope by John Milne in the late 1800s enabled the study of earthquake waves, marking the formal emergence of seismology. In parallel, the use of gravity and magnetic surveys began to gain prominence. Karl von Gauss and William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) made significant contributions to the understanding of the Earth's magnetic field and its internal structure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the late 19th century, Andrija Mohorovičić discovered the Earth's crust-mantle boundary, known as the Moho, through the study of seismic waves. This discovery confirmed that the Earth's interior is layered, offering a breakthrough in understanding its composition.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Early 20th Century: Geophysics as a Discipline</h3>
                <p>
                    Geophysics began to emerge as a distinct discipline in the early 20th century. The advent of new technologies for measuring Earth's physical properties, including electrical resistivity and gravity surveys, became essential for resource exploration, particularly in oil and minerals. Simultaneously, Alfred Wegener’s theory of continental drift (1912) laid the groundwork for later developments in plate tectonics, though his ideas were initially controversial.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In seismology, the 1930s saw the development of the first true seismographs, which allowed scientists to create models of the Earth’s inner structure. Richard Oldham (1906) and Andrija Mohorovičić furthered our understanding of Earth’s layers, and by the 1940s, seismologists had developed detailed models of the Earth’s mantle and core.
                </p>
                <h3> Mid-20th Century to Present: Plate Tectonics and Technological Innovation </h3>
                <p>
                    The most revolutionary development in geophysics came in the 1960s with the theory of plate tectonics, which explained the movement of the Earth's lithospheric plates and the formation of mountains, earthquakes, and volcanic activity. This theory was supported by findings from seafloor spreading, mid-ocean ridges, and the magnetic anomalies on the ocean floor, with key contributions from scientists like Harry Hess and Robert Dietz.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the latter half of the 20th century, technological innovations, such as satellite-based measurements and seismic tomography, transformed geophysics. Seismic tomography allowed for 3D imaging of the Earth’s interior, while remote sensing tools enhanced the study of the Earth's surface and atmosphere. Geophysics also became critical for monitoring environmental changes and studying natural disasters.
